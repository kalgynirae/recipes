This curry is my attempt to duplicate the "Chicken Curry" from the Indian
Cuisine restaurant in Gainesville, FL. This version is pretty darn close, but
there's still a little room for improvement.

Cooking time: 2 hours (caramelizing onions takes a long time! If you skip the
caramelized onions, you can do it in about 1 hour 15 minutes.)

## Step 1: Caramelize onions

* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 cup sliced red onion
* 1/8 tsp salt

Caramelize the onions over medium-low heat, stirring often and deglazing the
pan with water as necessary.  This should take roughly 40 minutes (see
[The Food Lab's analysis][1] for details).  Set the caramelized onions aside.

## Step 2: Prepare spices

* 3 tsp fennel seeds
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 2 tsp coriander seeds

Toast the seeds briefly and then grind into a powder.  Set aside.

* 1.25 tsp ground cloves
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp fenugreek powder

Mix these and then split the mixture into two batches.

* 1.5 tsp turmeric
* 1/4 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/8 tsp cayenne powder
* 1/2 tsp salt

Add these to one of the batches of cloves, cinnamon, etc.  Also add the toasted
and ground seeds to this batch.  Set this aside for the next step.

* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg

Add this to the *other* batch of cloves, cinnamon, etc.  Set this aside for the
very end of the recipe.

## Step 3: Make curry

* 2 tbsp ghee or butter
* 1/8 tsp asafoetida
* 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
* 10 green cardamom pods
* 2 cups sweet onion, diced finely
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3 lb chicken thighs with bone (or drumsticks)
* 1.5 cup chicken stock

Heat the ghee or butter in a large pot.  Add the asafoetida, cumin seeds, and
cardamom and fry for a few seconds.  Add the onions and salt, and cook until the
onions are soft and starting to caramelize (~15 minutes).  Add the large batch
of spices from earlier and cook for another minute.  Add the chicken thighs and
stir to coat them with the onion-spice mixture.  Add the chicken stock, cover,
and simmer until the chicken is cooked (~40 minutes).  Then uncover and continue
to simmer until the liquid has reduced and thickened.

## Step 4: Cook rice

Go back in time and make basmati rice.

## Step 5: Finish it up

Remove the curry from the heat.

* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* salt/MSG to taste

Mix these and the remaining spice batch (cloves, cinnamon, etc.) into the curry.

Serve over basmati rice.  Optionally garnish with fresh cilantro.
