This curry is my attempt to duplicate the "Chicken Curry" from the Indian
Cuisine restaurant in Gainesville, FL. This version is pretty darn close, but
there's still room for improvement.

Time: 60 minutes (25 prep + 35 cooking)
Serves: 4

## Step 1: Prepare spices

Curry powder:

* 1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds
* 1.5 tsp fennel seeds (try 1?)
* 1 tsp coriander seeds
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 1/4 tsp cayenne powder

Garam masala:

* 1/4 tsp whole cloves
* 1/4 tsp cardamom seeds (try less?)
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder
* 1/2 tsp fenugreek leaves (try more?, or 1/2 tsp *better ground*)
* 1/4 tsp peppercorns
* a few small pieces of star anise

## Step 2: Make curry

* 4 tbsp chicken fat (try +2 tbsp ghee?)
* 3 cups yellow onion, diced
* 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup golden raisins
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 2 tsp minced ginger

Heat the fat in a large pot.  Add the onions and cumin seeds, and cook on
medium-low heat for at least 20 minutes, until the onions are very soft.  Add
the salt, raisins, ginger, and garlic and cook for a few minutes more.  Add the
curry powder and 2/3 of the garam masala and cook for another minute or two.

* 1.25 cup water or chicken stock
* 2 tsp lemon juice

Add the water and lemon juice, remove from the heat, and blend into a smooth
gravy.

* 1 lb cooked dark-meat chicken

Add the chicken to the gravy, bring the gravy to a simmer, and cook until
thickened.

## Step 3: Cook rice

Go back in time and make basmati rice.

## Step 4: Finish it up

Remove the curry from the heat.

* 1/3 cup heavy cream

Mix the cream and remaining garam masala into the curry.

Serve over basmati rice.  Optionally garnish with fresh cilantro.
