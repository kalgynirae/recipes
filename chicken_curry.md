NOTE: this is still a draft.

This curry is my attempt to duplicate the "Chicken Curry" from the Indian
Cuisine restaurant in Gainesville, FL. This version is pretty darn close, but
there's still a little room for improvement.

Cooking time: 1 hour

## Step 1: Prepare spices

* 1 tsp fenugreek seeds
* 3 tsp fennel seeds
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 1/4 tsp cardamom seeds (try 1/2 tsp, since I removed cardamom from below)

Toast the seeds briefly and then grind into a powder.

* 1 tsp ground cloves
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder
* 1 tsp turmeric powder (try 2 tsp)
* 1/2 tsp cayenne powder
* 1 tsp salt

Add these to the ground seeds.

* 1/2 tsp ground cloves
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* (try mint or savory?)

Set these aside for later.

## Step 2: Make curry

* 4 tbsp ghee
* 3 cups yellow onion, diced large
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 1 tsp minced ginger
* 1.5 cup water or chicken stock

Heat the ghee in a large pot.  Add the onions and cook on medium-low heat for at
least 20 minutes, until the onions are very soft.  Add the ginger and garlic and
cook for a few minutes more.  Add the large batch of spices from earlier and
cook for another minute or two.

Add the water, remove from the heat, and blend into a smooth gravy.

* 1 lb cooked chicken thighs
* 2 tsp lemon juice

Add the chicken and lemon juice to the gravy, bring the gravy to a simmer, and
cook until thickened.

## Step 3: Cook rice

Go back in time and make basmati rice.

## Step 4: Finish it up

Remove the curry from the heat.

* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 tsp MSG

Mix these and the spices set aside earlier into the curry.

Serve over basmati rice.  Optionally garnish with fresh cilantro.
