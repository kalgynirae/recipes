NOTE: this is still a draft.

This curry is my attempt to duplicate the "Chicken Curry" from the Indian
Cuisine restaurant in Gainesville, FL. This version is pretty darn close, but
there's still a little room for improvement.

Cooking time: 1 hour

## Step 1: Prepare spices

* 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds (try slightly less?)
* 1.5 tsp fennel seeds
* 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
* 1/8 tsp cardamom seeds

Toast the seeds briefly and then grind into a powder.

* 1/2 tsp ground cloves
* 1/8 tsp cinnamon powder
* 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
* 1/2 tsp salt

Add these to the ground seeds.

* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* (try 1/8 tsp ground cardamom?)
* (nutmeg?)
* (mint or savory?)

Set these aside for later.

## Step 2: Make curry

* 3 tbsp ghee
* 2 cups yellow onion, diced (try less, maybe 1 or 1.5 cups?)
* 1/2 tsp minced garlic
* 1/2 tsp minced ginger
* 1/2 cup water (try chicken stock? also more?)

Heat the ghee in a large pot.  Add the onions and cook on medium-low heat for at
least 20 minutes, until the onions are very soft.  Add the ginger and garlic and
cook for a few minutes more.  Add the large batch of spices from earlier and
cook for another minute or two.

Add the water, remove from the heat, and blend into a smooth gravy.

* 1 lb cooked chicken thighs
* 1/2 tsp lemon juice

Add the chicken and lemon juice to the gravy, bring the gravy to a simmer, and
cook until thickened.

## Step 3: Cook rice

Go back in time and make basmati rice.

## Step 4: Finish it up

Remove the curry from the heat.

* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/12 tsp MSG

Mix these and the spices set aside earlier into the curry.

Serve over basmati rice.  Optionally garnish with fresh cilantro.
