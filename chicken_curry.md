Cooking time: 2 hours (caramelizing onions takes a long time!)

Note: Read the ingredient list carefully; some ingredients are mentioned in
multiple parts. For example, the recipe calls for 3 onions!

Acquire

* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 large yellow onion, diced finely
* 1/4 tsp salt
* small amounts of water for deglazing.

Caramelize about a quarter of the onions over medium heat, stirring often and
deglazing the pan with water as necessary. This should take about 45 minutes.
(See [The Food Lab's analysis][1] for details.) Set the caramelized onions
aside.

In a pot, heat

* 2 tbsp butter.

Once it's hot, add

* 2 large yellow onions, diced finely,
* 3/4 tsp salt

and cook until the onions are soft and starting to caramelize (~20 minutes).
Then, push the onions to one side of the pan, and in the other side of the pan
add

* 1 tbsp butter
* 8 cloves
* 1.5 tsp cumin seeds.

Fry for about a minute, and then add

* 1 tbsp minced garlic.

Fry for about 30 seconds, then add

* 3 tsp curry powder
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp cayenne powder.

Fry for about a minute, then add

* 8 chicken thighs
* 1/2 cup water.

Simmer until the chicken is cooked (about 30 minutes). In a small pan, heat

* 1 tbsp butter.

Once the butter is heated, add

* 2 tsp all-purpose flour.

Cook for about two minutes, and then add to the chicken. Remove the chicken from
the heat and add

* 1/4 cup half & half
* salt to taste.

Garnish with

* chopped fresh cilantro.

Serve over basmati rice.
