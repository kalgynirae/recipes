Cooking time: 1.5 hours (caramelizing onions takes a long time!)

## Step 1: Caramelize shallots (or onions)

* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 cup shallots (or onion), diced finely
* 1/8 tsp salt

Caramelize the shallots over medium-low heat, stirring often and deglazing the
pan with water as necessary.  This should take roughly 25 minutes (or 40 minutes
for onion; see [The Food Lab's analysis][1] for details).  Set the caramelized
shallots aside.

## Step 2: Prepare spices

* 2.5 tsp fennel seeds
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 2 tsp coriander seeds
* 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds

Toast the seeds briefly and then grind into a powder. Set aside.

* 1 tsp ground cloves
* 1 tsp ground allspice
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/2 tsp cayenne powder (optional, spicy)
* 3/4 tsp salt

Measure these together and set aside.

* 1/2 tsp asafoetida
* 1 tsp cumin seeds

Measure these and set aside.

## Step 3: Make curry

* 3 tbsp butter
* 2.5 cups yellow onion, diced finely
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp garlic, minced
* 4 oz tomato paste
* 2 lb chicken thighs
* 1 cup water

Heat the butter in a large pot. Add the asafoetida and whole cumin seeds (from
the previous step) and cook for about 30 seconds.  Add the onions and salt, and
cook until the onions are soft and starting to caramelize (~20 minutes).  Add
the garlic and cook for another minute.  Add the rest of the spices and cook for
another minute.  Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute.  Add the
chicken thighs and stir to coat them with the tomato spice mixture.  Add the
water, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked (~30 minutes).

## Step 4: Cook rice

Make basmati rice.

## Step 5: Finish it up

* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves, crumbled (or ground)
* salt to taste

Serve over basmati rice.
