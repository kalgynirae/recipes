This curry is my attempt to duplicate the "Chicken Curry" from the Indian
Cuisine restaurant in Gainesville, FL. This version is pretty darn close, but
there's still room for improvement.

Time: 25 minutes prep + 30 minutes cooking  
Serves: 4

## Step 1: Prepare spices

* 1 tsp fenugreek seeds
* 3 tsp fennel seeds
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 1/2 tsp cardamom seeds

Toast the seeds briefly and then grind into a powder.

* 1 tsp ground cloves
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder
* 1.5 tsp turmeric powder
* 1/2 tsp cayenne powder
* 1 tsp salt

Add these to the ground seeds.

* 1/2 tsp ground cloves
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp savory (try 1/2?)

Set these aside for later.

## Step 2: Make curry

* 3 tbsp ghee
* 3 cups yellow onion, diced large
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 1 tsp minced ginger
* 1.25 cup water or chicken stock

Heat the ghee in a large pot.  Add the onions and cook on medium-low heat for at
least 20 minutes, until the onions are very soft.  Add the ginger and garlic and
cook for a few minutes more.  Add the large batch of spices from earlier and
cook for another minute or two.

Add the water, remove from the heat, and blend into a smooth gravy.

* 1 lb cooked chicken thighs
* 2 tsp lemon juice

Add the chicken and lemon juice to the gravy, bring the gravy to a simmer, and
cook until thickened.

## Step 3: Cook rice

Go back in time and make basmati rice.

## Step 4: Finish it up

Remove the curry from the heat.

* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 tsp MSG

Mix these and the spices set aside earlier into the curry.

Serve over basmati rice.  Optionally garnish with fresh cilantro.
