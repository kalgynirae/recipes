This curry is my attempt to duplicate the "Chicken Curry" from the Indian
Cuisine restaurant in Gainesville, FL. This version is pretty darn close, but
there's still room for improvement.

Time: 60 minutes (25 prep + 35 cooking)
Serves: 4

## Step 1: Prepare spices

Curry powder:

* 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds
* 2 tsp fennel seeds
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 2 tsp turmeric powder
* 1/2 tsp cayenne powder

Garam masala:

* 3/4 tsp coriander seeds
* 3/4 tsp whole cloves
* 1/4 tsp cardamom seeds
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder

## Step 2: Make curry

* 4 tbsp ghee
* 3 cups yellow onion, diced large
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 2 tsp minced ginger

Heat the ghee in a large pot.  Add the onions and cook on medium-low heat for at
least 20 minutes, until the onions are very soft.  Add the ginger and garlic and
cook for a few minutes more.  Add the curry powder and 2/3 of the garam masala
and cook for another minute or two.

* 1.25 cup water or chicken stock
* 2 tsp lemon juice

Add the water and lemon juice, remove from the heat, and blend into a smooth
gravy.

* 1 lb cooked chicken thighs

Add the chicken to the gravy, bring the gravy to a simmer, and
cook until thickened.

## Step 3: Cook rice

Go back in time and make basmati rice.

## Step 4: Finish it up

Remove the curry from the heat.

* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* remaining garam masala

Mix these into the curry.

Serve over basmati rice.  Optionally garnish with fresh cilantro.
