% Mung Bean Dal
% Colin Chan

Prep time: 1.5 hours

Rinse, as necessary,

*   1 cup mung bean (or any type of pulse)

. Place them in a large pot with

*   4.5 cups water
*   2 bay leaves
*   1 tbsp lemon juice

and boil for roughly 1 hour (until the beans are soft and starting to fall
apart). Skim foam from the surface if it appears.

While the beans are boiling, toast and grind

*   1 tsp cumin seeds
*   1 tsp coriander seeds
*   1 tsp black mustard seeds
*   2 tsp fennel seeds

. Mix the ground spices with

*   2 tsp turmeric
*   1 tsp asafoetida
*   1 tsp ginger powder
*   1 tsp paprika
*   1 tsp oregano
*   1/2 tsp finely minced garlic

. In a small pan, heat

*   2 tbsp coconut oil

. Add the spices and fry for about 30 seconds. Add

*   3 oz tomato paste (1/2 can)

and fry a bit longer. Remove from the heat.

**Start making rice.**

When the beans are done boiling, add the fried spices+tomato and

*   diced carrots
*   other vegetables (after the appropriate delay, if they are, e.g., zucchini)

. Simmer for about 20 minutes more (until the veggies are cooked). Finish by
removing from the heat and adding

*   2 tbsp butter
*   1/4 cup half & half
*   ~1 tsp salt (to taste)

. Serve over rice.
