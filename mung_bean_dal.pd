% Mung Bean Dal
% Colin Chan

Prep time: ~1 hour

Add to a large pot:

*   3 cup water
*   2 cup chicken broth
*   1 cup peeled split mung beans (or any type of pulse)

Bring to a boil. Skim the foam off of the surface. Then add:

*   2 tsp tumeric
*   1 tbsp lemon juice

Boil for about 20 minutes, then add:

*   3/4? cup crushed or diced tomatoes
*   diced carrots

**Start making rice.**

Give the carrots a head start, and then add:

*   sliced zuccini

Wait about five minutes. Then, in a small pan, heat a tablespoon of ghee
or coconut oil and add:

*   2 tsp cumin seeds
*   2 tsp coriander seeds
*   1 tsp black mustard seeds
*   1/2 tsp finely minced garlic
*   1 tsp finely minced ginger
*   1 tsp asafoetida powder
*   1 tsp ground coriander

**Note:** Apparently it would be much tastier to toast the whole spices
over high heat in a dry pan, grind them, and then briefly fry them with
the rest of the spices.

Cook briefly until the seeds are **not burnt** and then stir into the
bean mixture. Continue to cook until the zuccini is soft, then remove
from heat and add:

*   1/4 cup half & half
*   salt (to taste)

Serve over rice.
