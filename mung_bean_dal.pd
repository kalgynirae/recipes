% Mung Bean Dal
% Colin Chan

Prep time: 1.5 hours

Rinse, as necessary,

*   1 cup mung bean (or any type of pulse)

Place them in a large pot with

*   4 cups water

and boil for roughly 1 hour (until the beans are soft and about to fall apart).
Skim foam off the surface if it appears.

While the beans are boiling, toast and grind

*   1 tsp cumin seeds
*   1 tsp coriander seeds
*   1 tsp black mustard seeds
*   2 tsp fennel seeds

Mix the ground spices with

*   2 tsp turmeric
*   1 tsp asafoetida
*   1 tsp ginger powder
*   1 tsp paprika
*   1 tsp oregano
*   1/2 tsp finely minced garlic

Heat 1 tbsp coconut oil in a small pan. Add the spices and fry for about a
minute.

**Start making rice.**

When the beans are done boiling, add the fried spices and

*   1 tbsp lemon juice
*   2 bay leaves
*   14 oz can diced tomatoes
*   diced carrots
*   other vegetables (after the appropriate delay, if they are, e.g., zucchini)

Simmer for about 20 minutes more (until the veggies are cooked). Finish by
removing from the heat and adding

*   1/2 cup half & half
*   1 tsp salt (taste it!)
*   1/4 tsp MSG ????

Serve over rice.
