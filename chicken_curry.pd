This recipe is an attempt to duplicate the Chicken Curry served at *Indian
Cuisine* in Gainesville.

**THIS RECIPE IS STILL A DRAFT.**

# Curry paste

Start by toasting and grinding

*   2 tsp cumin seeds
*   1 tsp coriander seeds
*   1 tsp fennel seeds
*   1 tsp black mustard seeds

. Mix the ground spices with

*   2 tsp garam masala
*   2 tsp curry powder
*   1 tsp asafoetida
*   1/2 tsp ground black pepper
*   1 tsp salt

. Sauté in butter

*   3 cups diced yellow onions

until the onions are getting soft. Add

*   4–6 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1 tsp minced fresh ginger

and continue to sauté. Transfer the onion-garlic-ginger to a blender, add the
dry spices and

*   1/4 cup chicken broth

and blend until almost smooth (perhaps adding some oil if necessary?).

# Chicken

Marinate

*   1.5–2 lb chicken (dark meat preferable)

in the onion-spice mixture in a bag in the refrigerator for two hours.

*   Bake in the oven?
*   ???
*   PROFIT!!
