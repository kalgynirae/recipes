This recipe is an attempt to duplicate the Chicken Curry served at *Indian
Cuisine* in Gainesville.

**THIS RECIPE IS STILL A DRAFT.**

# Curry paste

Start by toasting and grinding

*   2 tsp cumin seeds
*   1 tsp coriander seeds
*   1 tsp fennel seeds
*   1 tsp black mustard seeds
*   1 tsp black pepper

. Mix the ground spices with

*   2 tsp garam masala
*   2 tsp curry powder
*   2 tsp asafoetida

. Sauté in butter

*   3 large yellow onions, diced

until the onions are getting soft. Add

*   4–6 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1 tsp minced fresh ginger

and continue to sauté. Transfer the onion-garlic-ginger to a blender, add the
dry spices and

*   1/2 cup chicken broth

and blend until smooth (perhaps adding some oil if necessary?).

# Chicken

Marinate

*   2–3 lb chicken (dark meat preferable)

in the onion-spice mixture in a bag in the refrigerator for two hours.
