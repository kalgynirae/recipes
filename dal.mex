    ..part Spice mix

    ..tip You can optionally save time by preparing the spice mix while the lentils are simmering.

    ..* `1/2 tsp` cumin seeds
    ..* `2 tsp` coriander seeds
    ..* `1/2 tsp` chana dal
    ..* `1/2 tsp` toor dal
    ..* `4` dried curry leaves
    ..* `1/4 tsp` asafetida (hing)
    ..* `1 tsp` paprika
    ..* `1/2 tsp` ground sumac
    ..* `1/2 tsp` cayenne powder :tip:{This amount makes the dish only mildly spicy, but you can omit it if you want no heat at all.}

    ..# Toast the seeds, dal, and curry leaves until fragrant, then grind to a powder.

    ..# Combine with the remaining spices and set aside for later.

    ..part Dal

    ..* `2 cups` red lentils, rinsed well
    ..* `5 cups` water :tip:{It might be necessary to add more later.}
    ..* `1 inch (5 g)` ginger root, crushed :tip:{but ideally still in one piece so you can easily remove it later}
    ..* `1 tsp` turmeric powder
    ..* `3 cups` diced carrot
    ..* `1 3/4 tsp` table salt
    ..* `2 cups` sliced zucchini
    ..* `1/4 cup` coconut oil
    ..* `1 Tbsp` lemon juice (or more, to taste)
    ..* additional salt, to taste

    ..#(start=3) In a pot, combine the lentils, water, ginger, turmeric, carrot, and salt.

    ..# Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for roughly 20 minutes (until the lentils are soft and starting to fall apart).

    ..# Add the zucchini and continue to simmer for 10 minutes. :tip:{The goal is to add the zucchini near enough to the end of cooking that it won't become overcooked and start to disintegrate.}

    ..# In a small skillet, heat the coconut oil, then add the spice mix and fry for 30 seconds.

    ..# Stir the oil and spices into the lentils.

    ..# Remove the lentils from the heat, remove the ginger root, and
    add the lemon juice and additional salt to taste.

    ..# Serve alone or over rice.
