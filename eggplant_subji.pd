% Eggplant Subji (Tuesday Krishna lunch)
% Colin Chan; Jonathan Burnett

*   2 medium gold potatoes (diced)
*   1 large carrot (diced)
*   4 tbsp butter
*   28 oz can crushed tomatoes
*   16 oz can chickpeas (drained)
*   2 cups half & half
*   3 bay leaves
*   2 tsp sugar
*   2 tsp lemon juice

<!-- -->

*   2 tbsp coconut oil or ghee
*   2 tsp caraway seeds
*   3 tsp ground coriander
*   3 tsp paprika
*   2 tsp turmeric
*   1 tsp ground cumin
*   1 tsp asafoetida
*   1 eggplant (~1.2 lb) (diced large)
*   Large pinch of salt

<!-- -->

*   2 small zuccini (sliced)

Notes for next time:

*   More asafoetida? (already changed in the above amounts)
*   More sugar? (already changed in the above amounts)
*   Last time we used a 1.4lb eggplant, which was slightly too much. Hence
    the recommended 1.2lb.
*   Last time we had only 1/2 cup of half & half, so we used 2% milk for
    the rest.
