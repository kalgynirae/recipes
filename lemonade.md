title: Lemonade

Juice some lemons, then scale this to the amount of juice. 1 cup of juice makes about 6 cups of lemonade (assuming you pretty much completely fill the cups with ice before pouring in the lemonade, which *is* recommended).

Note: This makes rather strong lemonade. Colin likes it that way. If you want to dilute yours, you can partially fill your glass with water before pouring in the lemonade.
