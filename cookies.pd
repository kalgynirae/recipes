# Ingredients

*   1 stick (1 cup) butter-flavored crisco
*   200 g (1 cup) white sugar
*   140 g (7/8 cup) brown sugar
*   1/2 heaping teaspoon vanilla extract
*   1/2 heaping teaspoon maple flavoring
*   2 large eggs

<!---->

*   325 g (2.5 cups) cups all-purpose flour
*   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
*   1/2 teaspoon salt

<!---->

*   400 g (2.5 cups) cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

# Procedure

Combine the crisco, sugars, vanilla, and maple in a bowl. Add the
eggs one at a time, beating after each addition.

Set your oven to 375°F.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually mix
this into the crisco-sugar-egg mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips.

Form balls of dough[^1] approximately 1 inch in diameter and place them
on a cookie sheet. Put the cookie sheet into the oven. Wait 10 minutes,
then remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Let the cookies cool for 3
minutes on the cookie sheet and then for 10 minutes on a cooling rack.

[^1]: When forming a ball of dough, you should always attempt to include as
many chocolate chips as is reasonably possible. If you do this consistently,
you will probably start to run out of chocolate chips in the dough. This is
normal; simply add more chocolate chips and continue.
