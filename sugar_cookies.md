# Sugar Cookies and Royal Icing

I think this is just Alton Brown's recipe? No modifications?

Time: ??

Makes: too many cookies

## Cookies

### Ingredients

*   3 cups all-purpose flour
*   3/4 teaspoon baking powder
*   1/4 teaspoon salt
*   1 cup unsalted butter, softened
*   1 cup sugar
*   1 egg, beaten
*   1 tablespoon milk
*   powdered sugar, for rolling out dough

### Directions

Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Place butter
and sugar in large bowl of electric stand mixer and beat until light in
color. Add egg and milk and beat to combine. Put mixer on low speed,
gradually add flour, and beat until mixture pulls away from the side of
the bowl. Divide the dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate
for 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 375Â°F.

Sprinkle the rolling pin and the surface where you will roll out the
dough with powdered sugar. Remove a piece of dough from the refrigerator
and roll out to 1/4-inch thick. Check frequently to make sure the dough
is not sticking. If the dough has warmed during rolling, place a cold
cookie sheet on top for 10 minutes before continuing.

Arrange cookie cutters on top of the dough, push them straight down,
and then transfer the cookies to a parchment-lined cookie sheet one at a
time (use a spatula!). Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until the cookies are
just beginning to turn brown around the edges. Let the cookies sit on
the baking sheet for 2 minutes, and then move them to a wire rack.

## Icing

### Ingredients

*   3 ounces pasteurized egg whites (~{2.5 large eggs}' worth?)
*   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*   4 cups confectioners' sugar

### Directions

In a stand mixer, combine the egg whites and vanilla, and beat until
frothy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, and mix on low speed
until the sugar is incorporated and the mixture is shiny. Switch to high
speed and beat until the mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks. This should
take approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Add food coloring if desired
(remember that the color will darken over 24 hours).
