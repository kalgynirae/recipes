The relative amounts of salt and pepper are reduced, onion powder replaces onion salt, and
smoked paprika is added (because it’s delicious).

Makes about 1⁄4 cup of seasoning.

* 2 Tbsp (20 g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt
* 1⁄2 tsp (2 g) garlic powder
* 1⁄4 tsp (1 g) onion powder
* 1 tsp (3 g) paprika
* 1 tsp (2 g) ground black pepper
* 1⁄2 tsp (2 g) smoked paprika (optional)
