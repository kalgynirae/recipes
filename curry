2 tbsp cup coconut oil (or canola or vegetable oil)
1 can curry paste (Prik Khing or Panang is good)
2* cans coconut milk (*2.5 cans if you want it less spicy)
1 pinch of asafoetida (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ginger powder (or maybe more) (optional)
1.5 lb chicken breast
1/2 cup split mung bean (optional)
1/2 lb fresh green beens
4 potatoes (I used red potatoes last time)
4 big carrots
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder (or more, esp. with extra coconut milk) (optional)

Prepare:

*   Rinse and boil the mung beans if you're using them. (I just covered them
    with water so there was about a half-inch of water above them and then
    boiled until the water was gone; about 15? minutes of boiling.)
*   Cut the green beans.
*   Dice the potatoes, carrots, and chicken.

Cook:

*   Heat the coconut oil in a very large pan.
*   Add the curry paste and fry for three minutes. (also the spices?)
*   Add one can of coconut milk and the chicken, and cook for four minutes.
*   Gradually add the rest of the coconut milk.
*   Add the rest of the ingredients, and cook for about 45 minutes.
