1/4 cup coconut oil
1 can curry paste (Panang is good)
2.5 cans coconut milk
1 pinch of asafoetida
1/4 teaspoon ginger powder (or maybe more)
1.5 lb chicken breast
1 cup split mung bean
3/4 lb fresh green beens
5 potatoes (we used red potatoes last time)
4 big carrots
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder (or maybe more)

Prepare:

*   Rinse and boil the mung beans. I just covered them with water so there was
    about a half-inch of water above them and then boiled until the water was
    gone (about 10? minutes of boiling).
*   Cut the green beans.
*   Dice the potatoes, carrots, and chicken.

Cook:

*   Heat the coconut oil in a very large pan.
*   Add the curry paste and fry for three minutes. (also the spices?)
*   Add one can of coconut milk and the chicken, and cook for four minutes.
*   Gradually add the rest of the coconut milk.
*   Add the rest of the ingredients, and cook for about 45 minutes.

Suggest for next time:

*   more curry paste? It could use a bit more curry flavor, and it could also
    be a bit thinner (the mung beans make it thick)
