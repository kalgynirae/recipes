# Mung Bean Dal

Prep time: 1.5 hours

Rinse, as necessary,

*   1 cup split mung bean (or any type of pulse)

and soak for about 15 minutes. Drain and place them in a large pot with

*   4.5 cups water
*   2 bay leaves
*   1 tbsp lemon juice
*   1 cup diced carrots
*   other vegetables (add after an appropriate delay)

and boil for roughly 30 minutes (until the beans are soft and starting to fall
apart).

While the beans are boiling, toast and grind

*   1 tsp cumin seeds
*   1 tsp coriander seeds
*   1 tsp black mustard seeds
*   2 tsp fennel seeds

. Mix the ground spices with

*   2 tsp turmeric
*   1 tsp asafoetida
*   1 tsp ginger powder
*   1 tsp paprika
*   1 tsp dried oregano flakes
*   1/2 tsp finely minced garlic

**Start making rice.**

. In a small pan, heat

*   2 tbsp coconut oil

. Add the spices and fry for about 30 seconds. Add

*   3 oz tomato paste (1/2 can)

and fry a bit longer. Remove the fried spice+tomato mixture from the heat and
stir it into the beans.

Once the beans are ready (soft as described above), remove them from the heat
and add

*   1/4 cup half & half
*   ~1 tsp salt (to taste)

. Serve over rice.
