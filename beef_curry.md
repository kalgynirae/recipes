title: Beef Onion Curry
---

**THIS RECIPE IS STILL A DRAFT.**

Start by toasting

*   3 tsp cumin seeds
*   1.5 tsp coriander seeds
*   1.5 tsp fennel seeds
*   1.5 tsp black mustard seeds
*   1.5 tsp fenugreek seeds

. Mix the toasted spices with

*   3 tsp garam masala
*   3 tsp curry powder
*   1 tsp asafoetida
*   1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional)
*   1/2 tsp ground black pepper
*   1.5 tsp salt

. In a large frying pan, sauté

*   1/3 cup ghee or oil
*   3 cups diced yellow onions

. When the onions are starting to turn golden, add

*   3 tsp minced fresh garlic
*   2 tsp minced fresh ginger

and continue to sauté for a minute or two. Remove the solids from the pan,
leaving behind as much oil as possible. Switch to high heat, add more oil if
necessary, add

*   2 lb cubed beef

, and fry until the beef is browned on all sides (about three minutes).

Dump everything into a slow cooker and cook on high for at least two hours.

Optionally, add

*   1/2 cup diced green pepper

and let cook for another fifteen minutes.

Garnish with fresh cilantro (maybe), and serve over basmati rice.
