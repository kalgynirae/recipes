# Acquire

*   1 tbsp coconut oil (or canola or vegetable oil)
*   1 can curry paste (I recommend Prik Khing (spicy) or Masaman (not-so-spicy))
*   2* cans coconut milk (*2.5 cans if you want it less spicy)
*   1.5 lb chicken breast
*   4 potatoes (I used red potatoes last time)
*   4 big carrots
*   1/2 lb fresh green beens
*   1/4 cup split mung bean (optional)
*   1 pinch of asafoetida (optional)
*   1/2 teaspoon ginger powder (optional)
*   1 teaspoon turmeric powder (optional)

# Prepare

1.  Rinse and boil the mung beans if you're using them. (I just covered them
    with water so there was about a half-inch of water above them and then
    boiled until the water was gone; about 15? minutes of boiling.)
2.  Dice the chicken and potatoes.
3.  Cut the carrots and green beans.
3.  Cut the green beans.

# Cook

1.  Heat the coconut oil in a very large pan.
2.  Add the curry paste and fry for three minutes.
3.  Add one can of coconut milk and the chicken, and cook for four minutes.
4.  Gradually add the rest of the coconut milk.
5.  Add the rest of the ingredients, and cook for about 30 minutes (until
    potatoes are soft).
