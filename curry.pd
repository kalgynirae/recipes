# Acquire

*   1 tbsp coconut oil (or canola or vegetable oil)
*   1 can curry paste (I recommend the one that says "Yellow curry
    paste" (mild), or "Prik Khing" (spicy), or "Masaman" (mild))
*   1–1.5 lb chicken breast
*   2 cans coconut milk
*   4–5 small-ish potatoes (I like gold potatoes)
*   3 big carrots
*   1/2 lb fresh green beens
*   other vegetables (optional)
*   ginger powder (optional)
*   turmeric powder (optional)

# Prepare

1.  Dice the chicken, potatoes, and carrots.
2.  Cut the green beans (if they are too long?).

# Cook

1.  Heat the coconut oil in a very large pan.
2.  Add the curry paste and fry for three minutes.
3.  Add the chicken and cook for a couple of minutes.
4.  Gradually add the coconut milk.
5.  Add the potatoes and carrots; wait a few minutes.
6.  Add the green beans; wait a few minutes.
7.  Add the other vegetables as appropriate (the idea is to add things
    so that they all finish cooking at the same time).
5.  Continue to cook for about 25 minutes (until potatoes are soft).
