# Mac & Cheese

This is originally a Martha Stewart recipe but with some modifications.

## Ingredients

*   5 cups milk
*   6 tbsp unsalted butter
*   7/16 cup all-purpose flour
*   1.5 tsp salt
*   1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
*   1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
*   1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
*   16 oz grated sharp white cheddar
*   8 oz grated Gruyère or Asiago or Pecorino Romano
*   1.25 lb ditalini

## Method

1.  Preheat oven to 375°F.
2.  Warm the milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
3.  Melt the butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat.
4.  When the butter starts to bubble, add the flour. Cook, stirring, for 1
    minute.
5.  While whisking, slowly pour in the hot milk a little at a time to keep
    the mixture smooth. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture
    bubbles and becomes thick (8 to 12 minutes).
6.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the salt, nutmeg, black pepper,
    cayenne pepper, and about 3/4 of each grated cheese. Set this sauce aside.
7.  Undercook the ditalini (just 5 or 6 minutes). Transfer to a colander, rinse
    under cold running water, and drain well.
8.  Stir the ditalini into the cheese sauce.
9.  Pour the mixture into a baking dish.
10. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top.
11. Bake until golden brown on top (about 35 minutes).
