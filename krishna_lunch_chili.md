# Krishna Lunch Chili

This is a scaled-down version of the recipe used by [Krishna Lunch] at the University of Florida.

[Krishna Lunch]: https://krishnalunch.com/

* 2⁄3 cup oil
* 2 cups diced celery (~6 stalks)
* 2 cups diced carrot (~3 large carrots)
* 1.5 cups diced bell pepper (~1 large pepper)
* 1⁄3 cup diced jalapeño (~1 jalapeño)
* 5 g asafetida
* 10 g coriander, ground (~<span class=mixed-number>1 1⁄2</span> Tbsp)
* 8 g cumin, ground (~<span class=mixed-number>1 1⁄3</span> Tbsp)

<!---->

* 3 cups chickpeas (2 cans, drained)
* 3 cups kidney beans (2 cans, drained)
* 1.5 cups pinto beans (1 can, drained)
* 1.5 cups corn (1 can, drained)
* 2 tsp dried oregano
* 2 tsp dried basil
* 2 tsp dried parsley
* 2 tsp paprika
* 2 tsp chili powder
* 0.5 tsp ginger powder

<!---->

* 1 can (15oz) diced tomatoes
* 1⁄4 cup + 1 Tbsp brown sugar
* 1 Tbsp tamarind paste
* 2 Tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 3/4 cup TVP granules
* salt to taste
* lemon juice to taste

## Notes

Changes from the original Krishna Lunch recipe:

* The original recipe used equal parts (by volume) of molasses and (white) sugar for sweetening. We didn’t like the flavor of the molasses, so I replaced it with slightly more brown sugar and a little tamarind paste.
* I reduced the amounts of the dried herbs a little.
