# Chicken Curry v2

<aside class=important>

**There is a newer version of this recipe:** [Chicken Curry v2 (hyperchef)](https://www.hyperchef.net/recipes/chicken-curry-v2/).

</aside>

This is the second totally rewritten recipe in my attempt to duplicate the
"Chicken Curry" from the Indian Cuisine restaurant in Gainesville, FL.

Time: 1 hour (shallots) + 1 hour (base gravy) + 10 minutes (curry)   
Serves: 4

## Caramelized shallots

* 6 cups sliced shallots (12 shallots?)

Caramelize them: https://youtu.be/kEfJTmf9hDs

## Spices

* 1.5 tsp coriander seeds
* 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
* 1.5 tsp fennel seeds
* 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds
* 1/4 tsp whole cloves
* 1/4 tsp cardamom seeds
* 1/2 tsp peppercorns
* 2 star anise bits
* 1 bay leaf

Toast the spices, then grind them to a powder.

* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/4 tsp cayenne powder
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder
* 1/4 tsp ground fenugreek leaves
* 1/8 tsp ground mace

Add these to the earlier spices, and set the mixture aside for later.

## Base gravy

NOTE: This will make enough gravy for two batches of curry. Freeze one for
later!

* 1/2 cup oil
* 1 kg onion, sliced

Fry in a large pot until the onions are soft and starting to brown.

* 1 carrot, diced
* 1 green bell pepper, sliced

Add these and continue to fry for a few minutes.

* 2 Tbsp garlic paste
* 1 Tbsp ginger paste
* 2 Tbsp tomato paste

Add these, half of the *caramelized shallots*, and the *spice mix* from earlier,
and fry for a few minutes more.

* 2 cups chicken stock (or water)

Add and simmer for 30 minutes, then remove from the heat and blend until smooth.
Return to the heat and simmer gently for another 30 minutes.

## Rice

Make rice!

## Curry

* 1/4 cup tasty oil (e.g., chicken fat)

* 10 cloves
* 1/2 tsp cumin seeds

Fry for a few minutes.

* 1/6 cup golden raisins
* 2 tsp garlic paste
* 1 tsp ginger paste
* 1 tsp turmeric powder

Add and fry for a minute more.

* 3 cups base gravy

Add these and continue to heat until warm.
