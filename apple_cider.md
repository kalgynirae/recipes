title: Hot Spiced Apple Cider
---

Serves roughly 6.

Place the following in a large pot:

* 1/2 gallon apple juice
* 4 2-inch cinnamon sticks
* 2 star anise
* 12 allspice
* 8 cloves
* 1/4 orange (as a few slices)

Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat. Let the cider sit for a few hours.
(This gives the spices time to flavor the cider.)

Bring the cider to a boil again, then reduce to a simmer, taste, and add

* 1/4 cup sugar (likely not needed if the apple juice was sweet to begin with).

Remove from the heat and serve.
