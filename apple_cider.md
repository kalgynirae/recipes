% Hot Spiced Apple Cider

Serves roughly 6.

Place the following in a large pot:

* 1/2 gallon apple juice
* 5 2-inch cinnamon sticks
* 2 star anise
* 12 allspice
* 8 cloves

Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat. Let the cider sit for a few hours.
(This gives the spices time to flavor the cider.)

Bring the cider to a boil again, then reduce to a simmer and add

* 1 orange slice
* 1/4 cup sugar (optional but recommended).

Let simmer for about half an hour, then remove from the heat and serve.
