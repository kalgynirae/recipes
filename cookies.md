# Ingredients

*   1 cup butter-flavored crisco (or half crisco, half actual butter)
*   200 g (1 cup) white sugar
*   80 g (1/2? cup) brown sugar
*   1/2 heaping teaspoon vanilla extract
*   1/2 heaping teaspoon maple flavoring
*   2 large eggs

<!---->

*   340 g (2.5? cups) bread flour
*   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
*   1/4 teaspoon baking powder
*   1/2 teaspoon salt

<!---->

*   16 oz (2.5? cups) semi-sweet chocolate chips

# Procedure

Preheat your oven to 385°F.

Combine the crisco, sugars, vanilla, and maple flavoring in a bowl. Add the eggs
one at a time, beating after each addition.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
Gradually mix this into the crisco-sugar-egg mixture. Mix in the chocolate
chips.

Form balls of dough[^1] approximately 1 inch in diameter and place them
on a cookie sheet. Put the cookie sheet into the oven. Wait 10 minutes,
then remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Let the cookies cool for 3
minutes on the cookie sheet and then for 10 minutes on a cooling rack.

[^1]: When forming a ball of dough, you should always attempt to include as
many chocolate chips as is reasonably possible. If you do this consistently,
you will probably start to run out of chocolate chips in the dough. This is
normal; simply add more chocolate chips and continue.
