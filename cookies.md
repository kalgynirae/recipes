# Ingredients

*   1/2 cup unsalted butter
*   1/2 cup Crisco (vegetable shortening)
*   200 grams (1? cup) baker's sugar
*   80 grams (1/3? cup packed) brown sugar
*   3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
*   1/2 teaspoon maple extract (optional)
*   2 large eggs

<!---->

*   340 grams (2.75? cups) all-purpose or bread flour (or half of each)
*   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
*   1/4 teaspoon baking powder
*   1/2 teaspoon table salt

<!---->

*   14 oz (2.5? cups) semi-sweet chocolate chips

# Procedure

Preheat your oven to 385°F.

Carefully warm the butter and Crisco in a microwave, just enough that the butter
is partially melted. Add the sugars and mix thoroughly, making sure to break up
any clumps of sugar. Add the vanilla and maple extracts and mix. Add the eggs
one at a time, beating after each addition.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
Gradually mix this into the wet mixture. If you don't mind eating small amounts
of raw egg, taste the dough and add extra salt if needed. Mix in the chocolate
chips. (It will be a *lot* of chocolate chips!)

Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Form the
dough into 1-inch balls. Ideally, get as many chocolate chips as possible into
each ball (but not so many that the ball falls apart on the cookie sheet).
dough approximately 1 inch in diameter and place them on a cookie sheet. Bake for
10–12 minutes, until the cookies are just starting to turn golden. Let the
cookies cool on the cookie sheet for a few minutes and then on a cooling rack
until cool.
