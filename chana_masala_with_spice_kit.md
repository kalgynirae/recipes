title: Chana Masala (with spice kit)
---

Prep time: 10 minutes? (chop onion, garlic, ginger; open cans)  
Cooking time: 45 minutes

Ingredients:

*   spice jars #1 and #2
*   3 tbsp unsalted butter
*   2 cups yellow onion, diced small
*   2 tsp minced garlic
*   2 tsp minced (or grated) ginger
*   1 can (14 oz) petite diced tomatoes.
*   2 cans (15 oz each) chickpeas, one drained, the other not drained
*   2 tsp brown sugar
*   2 tsp lemon juice
*   2 tbsp heavy cream
*   rice (optional, basmati recommended)

In a large non-stick pan, heat the unsalted butter over medium heat.  Once hot,
add the yellow onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are
starting to soften and turn translucent or are starting to brown on the edges
(about 15 minutes).  Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another 30 seconds.
Then add spice jar #1 (the large one), mix well, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the
diced tomatoes, cook for 3 minutes more, and then add the chickpeas.

Don't forget to make rice if you want rice!

Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat (maintaining a simmer), cover, and cook
for about 20 minutes.  Then, remove the cover, add the brown sugar and lemon
juice, and continue to cook until thickened (5â€“10 minutes).  Remove from the
heat, add spice jar #2 and the heavy cream, and mix well.

Serve over basmati rice.
