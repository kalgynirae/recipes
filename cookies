1 cup butter-flavored crisco
1 cup white sugar
7/8 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon maple flavoring
2 large eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2+ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Combine the crisco, sugar, vanilla, and maple in a bowl. Add the
eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. It might be a good idea to
taste the mixture at this point to determine whether more vanilla or maple is
needed!

Set your oven to 375Â°F.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually mix
this into the crisco-sugar-egg mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips.

Form balls of dough* approximately 1 inch in diameter and place them on a cookie
sheet. Put the cookie sheet into the oven. Wait 10 minutes, then remove the
cookie sheet from the oven. Let the cookies cool for 2 or 3 minutes, and then
move them onto a cooling rack.

* When forming a ball of dough, you should always attempt to include as
many chocolate chips as is reasonably possible. If you do this consistently,
you will probably start to run out of chocolate chips in the dough. This is
normal; simply add more chocolate chips and continue.
