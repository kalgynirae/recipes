% Krishna Lunch Salad Dressing
% Krishna Lunch at UF; Colin Chan (minor tweaks)

# Acquire

*   1/2 cup powdered almonds
*   1/2 cup nutritional yeast
*   1/6 tsp asafoetida powder
*   3/4 tsp salt (reduced from 1 tsp; I think this is right now)
*   1/2 cup sunflower or safflower oil
*   3/4 cup water
*   1 tbsp Bragg liquid aminos (alternatively: soy sauce)

Yields roughly 1 3/4 cups.

# Prepare

1.  Put the ingredients into a blender, and blend for 30 seconds.
2.  Refrigerate. (Note: the dressing will thicken with refrigeration.)
