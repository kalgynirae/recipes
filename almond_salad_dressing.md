title: Almond Salad Dressing
---

This recipe originally came from [Krishna Lunch] at the University of Florida.
I've tweaked the amounts (and suggested some optional ingredients) to try to
achieve a taste closer to what I remember from eating Krishna Lunch many years
ago.

# Acquire

*   1/2 cup powdered almonds (or 1/3 cup whole almonds, maybe slightly less, ground to a loose powder)
*   1/3 cup nutritional yeast (currently I'm using [Anthony's brand])
*   1/8 tsp [asafoetida powder]
*   1/4 tsp table salt
*   1/2 cup sunflower or safflower oil
*   2/3 cup water
*   1.5 Tbsp Bragg Liquid Aminos
*   1 tsp rice vinegar

<!---->

*   1/8 tsp almond extract (optional)
*   1/2 tsp yeast extract (e.g., Vegemite) (optional)

Yields roughly 1.5 cups (~10 servings).

# Prepare

1.  Put the dry ingredients into a blender.
2.  Add the liquids and blend for 30 seconds.
3.  Taste. If it's too thick, add a small amount of extra water and blend
    briefly. (Note that it will thicken with refrigeration.)
4.  Adjust the flavor if desired using additional Bragg, vinegar, and/or the optional ingredients.
5.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
