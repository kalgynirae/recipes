title: Almond Salad Dressing
---

This recipe originally came from [Krishna Lunch] at the University of Florida,
but I’ve added vinegar and tweaked the amounts slightly to try to achieve a
taste closer to what I remember from eating Krishna Lunch many years ago.

## Ingredients

*   45g almonds (1/2 cup powdered or a loosely-packed 1/3 cup whole)
*   25g nutritional yeast (1/3 cup, I like [Anthony’s])
*   1/8 tsp [asafetida powder]
*   1/4 tsp table salt
*   1/2 cup sunflower or safflower oil
*   2/3 cup water
*   1.25 Tbsp Bragg Liquid Aminos (or soy sauce, or Bragg Coconut Liquid Aminos to avoid soy)
*   1.5 tsp white wine vinegar
*   1/8 tsp almond extract (optional)

Yields roughly 1.5 cups (~10 servings).

## Method

1.  Measure the dry ingredients into a blender.
2.  Add the liquids.
3.  Blend until smooth, at least 30 seconds.
4.  Taste. If it’s too thick, add a small amount of extra water and blend
    briefly. (Note that it will thicken a bit with refrigeration.)
5.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
