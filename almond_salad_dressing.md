title: Almond Salad Dressing
---

This recipe originally comes from Krishna Lunch at the University of Florida.
I've tweaked it a little to try to make it taste closer to the original.

# Acquire

*   1/4 cup powdered almonds
*   1/4 cup nutritional yeast
*   1/12 tsp asafoetida powder
*   1/2 tsp table salt
*   1/3 cup sunflower or safflower oil
*   1/3 cup water
*   1.25 tsp Bragg Liquid Aminos
*   1/4 tsp rice vinegar
*   1-2 drops almond extract (if you like that fake almond flavor)

Yields roughly 1 cup.

# Prepare

1.  Put the dry ingredients into a blender.
2.  Add the liquids and blend for 1 minute.
3.  Taste and observe the thickness. If it's too thick, add a small amount of
    extra water and blend briefly. Repeat if necessary. (Remember that it will
    thicken with refrigeration.)
2.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
