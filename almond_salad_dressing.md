% Almond Salad Dressing
% Krishna Lunch at UF; Colin Chan (minor tweaks)

# Acquire

*   1/4 cup powdered almonds
*   1/4 cup nutritional yeast ([Frontier Nutritional Yeast Mini Flakes][1] taste the best)
*   1/12 tsp asafoetida powder
*   1/4 tsp salt
*   1/3 cup sunflower or safflower oil
*   1/3 cup water
*   1.25 tsp Bragg Liquid Aminos
*   1/2 tsp rice vinegar (try white wine vinegar?)
*   1-2 drops almond extract

Yields roughly 1 cup.

# Prepare

1.  Put the dry ingredients into a blender and pulse a few times.
2.  Add the liquids and blend for 1 minute.
3.  Taste and observe the thickness. If it's too thick, add a small amount of
    extra water and blend briefly. Repeat if necessary. (Remember that it will
    thicken with refrigeration.)
2.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
