title: Almond Salad Dressing
---

This recipe originally comes from Krishna Lunch at the University of Florida.
I've tweaked it a little to try to make it taste closer to the original.

# Acquire

*   1/4 cup powdered almonds
*   1/4 cup nutritional yeast (currently I'm using [Anthony's brand])
*   1/12 tsp [asafoetida powder]
*   1/2 tsp table salt
*   1/3 cup sunflower or safflower oil
*   1/3 cup water
*   1 tsp Bragg Liquid Aminos

<!---->

*   1/4 tsp yeast extract (e.g., Vegemite) (optional â€” if using, reduce the
    amount of Bragg Liquid Aminos by 1/4 tsp)
*   1/4 tsp rice vinegar (optional)
*   1-2 drops almond extract (optional)

Yields roughly 1 cup.

# Prepare

1.  Put the dry ingredients into a blender.
2.  Add the liquids and blend for 1 minute.
3.  Taste and observe the thickness. If it's too thick, add a small amount of
    extra water and blend briefly. Repeat if necessary. (Remember that it will
    thicken with refrigeration.)
4.  Adjust the flavor if desired using the optional ingredients.
5.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
