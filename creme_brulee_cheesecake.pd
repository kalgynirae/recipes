# Acquire

*   26 graham cracker squares, crumbled
*   0.83 sticks of butter, melted
*   1 tablespoon sugar

*   5 egg yolks and 1.5 egg whites
*   1 tablespoon vanilla extract
*   2/3 cup heavy cream
*   1 cup sour cream
*   20 oz cream cheese (Neufchâtel or 1/3 fat kind works well)
*   1 cup sugar

*   1/3 cup sugar (for carmelizing)

# Prepare

This recipe takes about 40 minutes to prepare, 2 hours to bake, and 5 or 6
hours in the refrigerator.

I usually make this in a 13"×9" glass pan.

## The crust

Preheat an oven to 300°F. Brush a little melted butter on the bottom and
sides of the cheesecake pan.

In a small bowl, combine the graham crackers, butter, and sugar, and press
into bottom of the pan. (Use a flat-bottomed glass cup filled with weights to
help with the pressing.) Bake the crust for 10 minutes, and then set aside to
cool.

## The filling

Prepare a water bath for the cheesecake. For this you need a pan with tall
sides that is large enough to hold your cheesecake pan. Fill it about half-way
with water (but not so much that water will spill over the edges when you set
the cheesecake pan in). Place this in the oven to preheat.

Combine the eggs, vanilla, and heavy cream, and set aside.

Beat the sour cream for 10 seconds. Add the cream cheese and sugar, and mix on
low for about 30 seconds. Turn up to medium, and start to slowly add in the
vanilla-egg-cream mixture. When about half of it is incorporated, stop and
scrape the edges of the bowl with a spatula. Continue mixing and adding the
mixture until the rest of the ingredients are incorporated, stopping to scrape
the sides of the bowl occasionally. Once completely combined, pour into the
cooled crust.

Lower the oven temperature to 250°F, and place the cheesecake into your
preheated water bath in the oven. Bake for 1 hour, and then turn the oven off.
Open the door for 1 minute to let out some of the heat, and then close the door
for one more hour. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and place it in
the refrigerator for about 6 hours to cool completely.

## The carmelizing

Just prior to serving, sprinkle sugar onto the cheesecake and carmelize using a
torch. (Reference a crème brûlée recipe for more details.) Serve and enjoy!
