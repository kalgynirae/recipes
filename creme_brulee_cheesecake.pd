% Crème Brûlée Cheesecake
% Alton Brown; Colin Chan

# Acquire

*   26 graham cracker squares, crumbled
*   0.83 sticks of butter, melted
*   1 tablespoon sugar

*   20 oz cream cheese (Neufchâtel or 1/3 fat kind works well)
*   1 cup sour cream
*   1 cup sugar, and extra for the topping
*   1 tablespoon vanilla extract
*   5 egg yolks and 1.5 egg whites
*   2/3 cup heavy cream

# Prepare

Preheat an oven to 300°F. Brush some of the melted butter on the bottom and
sides of a pan.

In a small bowl, combine the graham crackers, butter, and sugar, and press
into bottom of the pan. (Use a flat-bottomed glass cup filled with weights to
help with the pressing.) Bake the crust for 10 minutes, and then set aside to
cool.

Beat the sour cream for 10 seconds. Add the cream cheese and sugar and mix on
low for 30 seconds, and then turn up to medium. Scrape the edges of the bowl
periodically with a rubber spatula.

In a separate container, combine vanilla, eggs, and heavy cream. While mixing
on medium, slowly pour the liquid mixture in. When half of it is incorporated,
stop and scrape. Continue adding the mixture until the rest of the ingredients
are incorporated. Once completely combined, pour into cooled crust.

Lower oven temperature to 250°F. Place cheesecake into a preheated water bath
in the oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off and open the door for one minute.
Close the door for one more hour. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and
place in the refrigerator for 6 hours to cool completely.

Just prior to serving, spread sugar onto the top of the cheesecake and
carmelize using a torch. (Find a crème brûlée recipe for details.) To slice,
place a knife into a hot water bath and wipe dry prior to making each slice.
