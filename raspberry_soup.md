who originally got it from a chef on a cruise.

* 1 pint fresh raspberries
* 1 cups sour cream
* 1/2 cup whole milk
* 1/2 cup ginger ale
* 1/8 cup sugar
* 1 tbsp triple sec

1.  Use a blender or food processor to puree raspberries until smooth.
2.  Over a non reactive bowl strain pureed fruit through a cheese cloth or fine
    sieve to remove seeds. Discard seeds.
3.  Whisk together remaining ingredients, and add in the pureed and sieved
    raspberries.
4.  Pour soup into a glass jar or bowl. Cover well and refrigerate until very
    cold.
