# Ingredients

## Wet

* 3-4 overripe bananas
* 1/4 cup butter, softened
* 1 eggs
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 8 oz sweetened condensed milk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp almond extract (optional)

## Dry

* 210 g (1 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder
* 1/2 tsp ground cloves

# Procedure

Preheat an oven to 350°F.

In a bowl, mash the bananas with a fork, and mix well with the rest of the wet
ingredients. In a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients. Pour the dry
mixture on top of the wet, and stir just until combined. Pour into a bread pan.

Bake for 45–55 minutes (check for doneness by poking a knife into the center of
the loaf and seeing if it comes out clean).
