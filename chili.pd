# Acquire

*   2 tbsp canola oil
*   1 sweet onion, diced
*   2.3 lb ground beef
*   1 tsp freshly-ground black pepper
*   2 tsp cumin powder
*   1 tsp fennel seeds
*   6 garlic cloves, minced
*   1 cup chicken stock
*   1 (16 oz) can chili beans in medium sauce
*   1 (16 oz) can pinto beans
*   1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatos
*   1/4 cup chili powder
*   1 tsp ground cayenne pepper
*   1/2 tsp nutmeg (if you want it to taste like Christmas)
*   1/2 tsp seasoned salt

# Cook

Start by saut√©ing the onion over medium-high heat. When the onion has started to
brown or burn a bit, increase to high heat and add the ground beef. When the
ground beef is roughly 80% browned, add the black pepper, cumin, fennel, and
garlic. When the meat is completely browned, add the liquids, followed by the
remaining spices. Reduce the heat and simmer for roughly an hour.
