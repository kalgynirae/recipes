*   6 garlic cloves
*   1 tsp freshly-ground black pepper
*   2 tsp cumin powder
*   1 tsp fennel seeds
*   1 cup chicken (or beef) stock (or broth)
*   1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatos
*   1 (16 oz) can chili beans in medium sauce
*   1 (16 oz) can pinto beans
*   1 (16 oz) can chickpeas
*   1/4 cup chili powder
*   1 tsp ground cayenne pepper
*   1/2 tsp nutmeg (if you want it to taste like Christmas)
*   1/2 tsp seasoned salt

# Prepare

*   Dice the onion.
*   Mince the garlic cloves.
*   Open the cans.
*   Drain the pinto beans and chickpeas(?)

# Cook

Start by saut√©ing the onion with the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
When the onion has started to brown, increase to high heat and add the
garlic and ground beef. When the ground beef is roughly 80% browned,
add the black pepper, cumin, and fennel. When the ground beef is
completely browned, add the liquids and beans, followed by the
remaining spices. Reduce the heat and simmer for roughly an hour.
