# Cook

Start by saut√©ing the onion with the oil in a large pot over medium-high
heat. When the onion has started to brown, increase to high heat and add
the garlic and ground beef. When the ground beef is mostly browned, add
the black pepper, fennel, and coriander. When the ground beef is
completely browned, add the liquids and beans, followed by the remaining
spices and chocolate. Reduce the heat and simmer for roughly an hour.
